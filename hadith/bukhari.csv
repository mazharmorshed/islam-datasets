bukhari1,bukhari,1,Bukhari,1,1,"Narrated 'Umar bin Al-Khattab:

 I heard Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) saying, ""The reward of deeds depends upon the 
 intentions and every person will get the reward according to what he 
 has intended. So whoever emigrated for worldly benefits or for a woman
 to marry, his emigration was for what he emigrated for.""",,Sahih
bukhari2,bukhari,1,Bukhari,2,2," Narrated 'Aisha:

 (the mother of the faithful believers) Al-Harith bin Hisham asked Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) ""O Allah's Messenger! How is the Divine Inspiration revealed to you?"" Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) replied, ""Sometimes it is (revealed) like the ringing of a bell, this form of Inspiration is the hardest of all and then this state passes off after I have grasped what is inspired. Sometimes the Angel comes in the form of a man and talks to me and I grasp whatever he says."" 'Aisha added: Verily I saw the Prophet (ﷺ) being inspired divinely on a very cold day and noticed the sweat dropping from his forehead (as the Inspiration was over).",,Sahih
bukhari3,bukhari,1,Bukhari,3,3,"Narrated 'Aisha (the mother of the faithful believers): The commencement of the Divine Inspiration to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) was in the form of good dreams which came true like bright daylight, and then the love of seclusion was bestowed upon him. He used to go in seclusion in the cave of Hira where he used to worship (Allah alone) continuously for many days before his desire to see his family. He used to take with him the journey food for the stay and then come back to (his wife) Khadija to take his food likewise again till suddenly the Truth descended upon him while he was in the cave of Hira. The angel came to him and asked him to read. The Prophet (ﷺ) replied, ""I do not know how to read."" The Prophet (ﷺ) added, ""The angel caught me (forcefully) and pressed me so hard that I could not bear it any more. He then released me and again asked me to read and I replied, 'I do not know how to read.' Thereupon he caught me again and pressed me a second time till I could not bear it any more. He then released me and again asked me to read but again I replied, 'I do not know how to read (or what shall I read)?' Thereupon he caught me for the third time and pressed me, and then released me and said, 'Read in the name of your Lord, who has created (all that exists), created man from a clot. Read! And your Lord is the Most Generous."" (96.1, 96.2, 96.3) Then Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) returned with the Inspiration and with his heart beating severely. Then he went to Khadija bint Khuwailid and said, ""Cover me! Cover me!"" They covered him till his fear was over and after that he told her everything that had happened and said, ""I fear that something may happen to me."" Khadija replied, ""Never! By Allah, Allah will never disgrace you. You keep good relations with your kith and kin, help the poor and the destitute, serve your guests generously and assist the deserving calamity-afflicted ones."" Khadija then accompanied him to her cousin Waraqa bin Naufal bin Asad bin 'Abdul 'Uzza, who, during the pre-Islamic Period became a Christian and used to write the writing with Hebrew letters. He would write from the Gospel in Hebrew as much as Allah wished him to write. He was an old man and had lost his eyesight. Khadija said to Waraqa, ""Listen to the story of your nephew, O my cousin!"" Waraqa asked, ""O my nephew! What have you seen?"" Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) described whatever he had seen. Waraqa said, ""This is the same one who keeps the secrets (angel Gabriel) whom Allah had sent to Moses. I wish I were young and could live up to the time when your people would turn you out."" Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) asked, ""Will they drive me out?"" Waraqa replied in the affirmative and said, ""Anyone (man) who came with something similar to what you have brought was treated with hostility; and if I should remain alive till the day when you will be turned out then I would support you strongly."" But after a few days Waraqa died and the Divine Inspiration was also paused for a while.",,Sahih
bukhari4,bukhari,1,Bukhari,3,4,"Narrated Jabir bin 'Abdullah Al-Ansari (while talking about the period of pause in revelation) reporting the speech of the Prophet: ""While I was walking, all of a sudden I heard a voice from the sky. I looked up and saw the same angel who had visited me at the cave of Hira' sitting on a chair between the sky and the earth. I got afraid of him and came back home and said, 'Wrap me (in blankets).' And then Allah revealed the following Holy Verses (of Quran): 'O you (i.e. Muhammad)! wrapped up in garments!' Arise and warn (the people against Allah's Punishment),... up to 'and desert the idols.' (74.1-5) After this the revelation started coming strongly, frequently and regularly.""",,Sahih
bukhari5,bukhari,1,Bukhari,4,5," Narrated Said bin Jubair:

 Ibn 'Abbas in the explanation of the statement of Allah ""Move not your tongue concerning (the Quran) to make haste therewith."" (75.16) said ""Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) used to bear the revelation with great trouble and used to move his lips (quickly) with the Inspiration."" Ibn 'Abbas moved his lips saying, ""I am moving my lips in front of you as Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) used to move his."" Said moved his lips saying: ""I am moving my lips, as I saw Ibn 'Abbas moving his."" Ibn 'Abbas added, ""So Allah revealed 'Move not your tongue concerning (the Qur'an) to make haste therewith. It is for Us to collect it and to give you (O Muhammad) the ability to recite it (the Quran)' (75.16-17) which means that Allah will make him (the Prophet) remember the portion of the Qur'an which was revealed at that time by heart and recite it. The statement of Allah: 'And when we have recited it to you (O Muhammad through Gabriel) then you follow its (Quran) recital' (75.18) means 'listen to it and be silent.' Then it is for Us (Allah) to make it clear to you' (75.19) means 'Then it is (for Allah) to make you recite it (and its meaning will be clear by itself through your tongue). Afterwards, Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) used to listen to Gabriel whenever he came and after his departure he used to recite it as Gabriel had recited it.""",,Sahih
bukhari6,bukhari,1,Bukhari,5,6," Narrated Ibn 'Abbas:

 Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) was the most generous of all the people, and he used 
 to reach the peak in generosity in the month of Ramadan when Gabriel 
 met him. Gabriel used to meet him every night of Ramadan to teach him 
 the Qur'an. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) was the most generous person, even more 
 generous than the strong uncontrollable wind (in readiness and haste 
 to do charitable deeds).",,Sahih
bukhari7,bukhari,1,Bukhari,6,7," Narrated 'Abdullah bin 'Abbas:

 Abu Sufyan bin Harb informed me that Heraclius had sent a messenger to
 him while he had been accompanying a caravan from Quraish. They were 
 merchants doing business in Sham (Syria, Palestine, Lebanon and 
 Jordan), at the time when Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) had truce with Abu Sufyan 
 and Quraish infidels. So Abu Sufyan and his companions went to 
 Heraclius at Ilya (Jerusalem). Heraclius called them in the court and 
 he had all the senior Roman dignitaries around him. He called for his 
 translator who, translating Heraclius's question said to them, ""Who 
 amongst you is closely related to that man who claims to be a 
 Prophet?"" Abu Sufyan replied, ""I am the nearest relative to him 
 (amongst the group).""

 Heraclius said, ""Bring him (Abu Sufyan) close to me and make his 
 companions stand behind him."" Abu Sufyan added, Heraclius told his 
 translator to tell my companions that he wanted to put some questions 
 to me regarding that man (The Prophet) and that if I told a lie they 
 (my companions) should contradict me."" Abu Sufyan added, ""By Allah! 
 Had I not been afraid of my companions labeling me a liar, I would not
 have spoken the truth about the Prophet. The first question he asked 
 me about him was:

 'What is his family status amongst you?' 

 I replied, 'He belongs to a good (noble) family amongst us.' 

 Heraclius further asked, 'Has anybody amongst you ever claimed the 
 same (i.e. to be a Prophet) before him?'

 I replied, 'No.'

 He said, 'Was anybody amongst his ancestors a king?'

 I replied, 'No.'

 Heraclius asked, 'Do the nobles or the poor follow him?'

 I replied, 'It is the poor who follow him.'

 He said, 'Are his followers increasing decreasing (day by day)?'

 I replied, 'They are increasing.'

 He then asked, 'Does anybody amongst those who embrace his religion 
 become displeased and renounce the religion afterwards?'

 I replied, 'No.'

 Heraclius said, 'Have you ever accused him of telling lies before his 
 claim (to be a Prophet)?'

 I replied, 'No. '

 Heraclius said, 'Does he break his promises?'

 I replied, 'No. We are at truce with him but we do not know what he 
 will do in it.' I could not find opportunity to say anything against 
 him except that.

 Heraclius asked, 'Have you ever had a war with him?'

 I replied, 'Yes.'

 Then he said, 'What was the outcome of the battles?'

 I replied, 'Sometimes he was victorious and sometimes we.'

 Heraclius said, 'What does he order you to do?'

 I said, 'He tells us to worship Allah and Allah alone and not to 
 worship anything along with Him, and to renounce all that our 
 ancestors had said. He orders us to pray, to speak the truth, to be 
 chaste and to keep good relations with our Kith and kin.'

 Heraclius asked the translator to convey to me the following, I asked 
 you about his family and your reply was that he belonged to a very 
 noble family. In fact all the Apostles come from noble families 
 amongst their respective peoples. I questioned you whether anybody 
 else amongst you claimed such a thing, your reply was in the negative.
 If the answer had been in the affirmative, I would have thought that 
 this man was following the previous man's statement. Then I asked you 
 whether anyone of his ancestors was a king. Your reply was in the 
 negative, and if it had been in the affirmative, I would have thought 
 that this man wanted to take back his ancestral kingdom.

 I further asked whether he was ever accused of telling lies before he 
 said what he said, and your reply was in the negative. So I wondered 
 how a person who does not tell a lie about others could ever tell a 
 lie about Allah. I, then asked you whether the rich people followed 
 him or the poor. You replied that it was the poor who followed him. 
 And in fact all the Apostle have been followed by this very class of 
 people. Then I asked you whether his followers were increasing or 
 decreasing. You replied that they were increasing, and in fact this is
 the way of true faith, till it is complete in all respects. I further 
 asked you whether there was anybody, who, after embracing his 
 religion, became displeased and discarded his religion. Your reply was
 in the negative, and in fact this is (the sign of) true faith, when 
 its delight enters the hearts and mixes with them completely. I asked 
 you whether he had ever betrayed. You replied in the negative and 
 likewise the Apostles never betray. Then I asked you what he ordered 
 you to do. You replied that he ordered you to worship Allah and Allah 
 alone and not to worship any thing along with Him and forbade you to 
 worship idols and ordered you to pray, to speak the truth and to be 
 chaste. If what you have said is true, he will very soon occupy this 
 place underneath my feet and I knew it (from the scriptures) that he 
 was going to appear but I did not know that he would be from you, and 
 if I could reach him definitely, I would go immediately to meet him 
 and if I were with him, I would certainly wash his feet.' Heraclius 
 then asked for the letter addressed by Allah's Messenger

 which was delivered by Dihya to the Governor of Busra, who forwarded 
 it to Heraclius to read. The contents of the letter were as follows: 
 ""In the name of Allah the Beneficent, the Merciful (This letter is) 
 from Muhammad the slave of Allah and His Apostle to Heraclius the 
 ruler of Byzantine. Peace be upon him, who follows the right path. 
 Furthermore I invite you to Islam, and if you become a Muslim you will
 be safe, and Allah will double your reward, and if you reject this 
 invitation of Islam you will be committing a sin of
 Arisiyin (tillers, farmers i.e. your people). And (Allah's Statement:)

 'O people of the scripture! Come to a word common to you and us that 
 we worship none but Allah and that we associate nothing in worship 
 with Him, and that none of us shall take others as Lords beside Allah.
 Then, if they turn away, say: Bear witness that we are Muslims (those 
 who have surrendered to Allah).' (3:64).

 Abu Sufyan then added, ""When Heraclius had finished his speech and had
 read the letter, there was a great hue and cry in the Royal Court. So 
 we were turned out of the court. I told my companions that the 
 question of Ibn-Abi-Kabsha) (the Prophet (ﷺ) Muhammad) has become so 
 prominent that even the King of Bani Al-Asfar (Byzantine) is afraid of
 him. Then I started to become sure that he (the Prophet) would be the 
 conqueror in the near future till I embraced Islam (i.e. Allah guided 
 me to it).""

 The sub narrator adds, ""Ibn An-Natur was the Governor of llya' 
 (Jerusalem) and Heraclius was the head of the Christians of Sham. Ibn 
 An-Natur narrates that once while Heraclius was visiting ilya' 
 (Jerusalem), he got up in the morning with a sad mood. Some of his 
 priests asked him why he was in that mood? Heraclius was a foreteller 
 and an astrologer. He replied, 'At night when I looked at the stars, I
 saw that the leader of those who practice circumcision had appeared 
 (become the conqueror). Who are they who practice circumcision?' The 
 people replied, 'Except the Jews nobody practices circumcision, so you
 should not be afraid of them (Jews).

 'Just Issue orders to kill every Jew present in the country.'

 While they were discussing it, a messenger sent by the king of Ghassan
 to convey the news of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) to Heraclius was brought in. 
 Having heard the news, he (Heraclius) ordered the people to go and see
 whether the messenger of Ghassan was circumcised. The people, after 
 seeing him, told Heraclius that he was circumcised. Heraclius then 
 asked him about the Arabs. The messenger replied, 'Arabs also practice
 circumcision.'

 (After hearing that) Heraclius remarked that sovereignty of the 'Arabs
 had appeared. Heraclius then wrote a letter to his friend in Rome who 
 was as good as Heraclius in knowledge. Heraclius then left for Homs. 
 (a town in Syrian and stayed there till he received the reply of his 
 letter from his friend who agreed with him in his opinion about the 
 emergence of the Prophet (ﷺ) and the fact that he was a Prophet. On that 
 Heraclius invited all the heads of the Byzantines to assemble in his 
 palace at Homs. When they assembled, he ordered that all the doors of 
 his palace be closed. Then he came out and said, 'O Byzantines! If 
 success is your desire and if you seek right guidance and want your 
 empire to remain then give a pledge of allegiance to this Prophet 
 (i.e. embrace Islam).'

 (On hearing the views of Heraclius) the people ran towards the gates 
 of the palace like onagers but found the doors closed. Heraclius 
 realized their hatred towards Islam and when he lost the hope of their
 embracing Islam, he ordered that they should be brought back in 
 audience.

 (When they returned) he said, 'What already said was just to test the 
 strength of your conviction and I have seen it.' The people prostrated
 before him and became pleased with him, and this was the end of 
 Heraclius's story (in connection with his faith).",,Sahih

 (principles):

 perfectly.

 ascription of partners to Allah) and gets the punishment in this

 When the Prophet (ﷺ) came to Medina, he stayed first with his grandfathers
 or maternal uncles from Ansar. He offered his prayers facing 
 Baitul-Maqdis (Jerusalem) for sixteen or seventeen months, but he 
 wished that he could pray facing the Ka'ba (at Mecca). The first 
 prayer which he offered facing the Ka'ba was the 'Asr prayer in the 
 company of some people. Then one of those who had offered that prayer 
 with him came out and passed by some people in a mosque who were 
 bowing during their prayers (facing Jerusalem). He said addressing 
 them, ""By Allah, I testify that I have prayed with Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) 
 facing Mecca (Ka'ba).' Hearing that, those people changed their 
 direction towards the Ka'ba immediately. Jews and the people of the 
 scriptures used to be pleased to see the Prophet (ﷺ) facing Jerusalem in 
 prayers but when he changed his direction towards the Ka'ba, during 
 the prayers, they disapproved of it.

 (Mecca) in prayers, some Muslims had died or had been killed and we

I said to Ibn `Abbas, ""Nauf-Al-Bakali claims that Moses (the companion of Khadir) was not the 
Moses of Bani Israel but he was another Moses."" Ibn `Abbas remarked that the enemy of Allah (Nauf) 
was a liar.

Narrated Ubai bin Ka`b:

The Prophet (ﷺ) said, ""Once the Prophet (ﷺ) Moses stood up and addressed Bani Israel. He was asked, ""Who 
is the most learned man amongst the people. He said, ""I am the most learned."" Allah admonished 
Moses as he did not attribute absolute knowledge to Him (Allah). So Allah inspired to him ""At the 
junction of the two seas there is a slave amongst my slaves who is more learned than you."" Moses 
said, ""O my Lord! How can I meet him?"" Allah said: Take a fish in a large basket (and proceed) and 
you will find him at the place where you will lose the fish. So Moses set out along with his (servant) 
boy, Yusha` bin Noon and carried a fish in a large basket till they reached a rock, where they laid their 
heads (i.e. lay down) and slept. The fish came out of the basket and it took its way into the sea as in a 
tunnel. So it was an amazing thing for both Moses and his (servant) boy. They proceeded for the rest 
of that night and the following day. When the day broke, Moses said to his (servant) boy: ""Bring us 
our early meal. No doubt, we have suffered much fatigue in this journey."" Moses did not get tired till 
he passed the place about which he was told. There the (servant) boy told Moses, ""Do you remember 
when we betook ourselves to the rock, I indeed forgot the fish."" Moses remarked, ""That is what we 
have been seeking. So they went back retracing their footsteps, till they reached the rock. There they 
saw a man covered with a garment (or covering himself with his own garment). Moses greeted him. 
Al-Khadir replied saying, ""How do people greet each other in your land?"" 
Moses said, ""I am Moses."" He asked, ""The Moses of Bani Israel?"" Moses replied in the affirmative 
and added, ""May I follow you so that you teach me of that knowledge which you have been taught."" 
Al-Khadir replied, ""Verily! You will not be able to remain patient with me, O Moses! I have some of 
the knowledge of Allah which He has taught me and which you do not know, while you have some 
knowledge which Allah has taught you which I do not know."" Moses said, ""Allah willing, you will 
find me patient and I will disobey no order of yours. So both of them set out walking along the 
seashore, as they did not have a boat. In the meantime a boat passed by them and they requested the 
crew of the boat to take them on board. The crew recognized Al-Khadir and took them on board 
without fare. Then a sparrow came and stood on the edge of the boat and dipped its beak once or twice 
in the sea. Al-Khadir said: ""O Moses! My knowledge and your knowledge have not decreased Allah's 
knowledge except as much as this sparrow has decreased the water of the sea with its beak."" Al- 
Khadir went to one of the planks of the boat and plucked it out. Moses said, ""These people gave us a 
free lift but you have broken their boat and scuttled it so as to drown its people."" Al-Khadir replied, 
""Didn't I tell you that you will not be able to remain patient with me."" Moses said, ""Call me not to 
account for what I forgot."" The first (excuse) of Moses was that he had forgotten. 
Then they proceeded further and found a boy playing with other boys. Al-Khadir took hold of the 
boy's head from the top and plucked it out with his hands (i.e. killed him). Moses said, ""Have you 
killed an innocent soul who has killed none."" Al-Khadir replied, ""Did I not tell you that you cannot 
remain patient with me?"" Then they both proceeded till when they came to the people of a town, they 
asked them for food, but they refused to entertain them. Then they found there a wall on the point of 
collapsing. Al-Khadir repaired it with his own hands. Moses said, ""If you had wished, surely you 
could have taken wages for it."" Al-Khadir replied, ""This is the parting between you and me."" The 
Prophet added, ""May Allah be Merciful to Moses! Would that he could have been more patient to 
learn more about his story with Al-Khadir. """,,Sahih

Once we were traveling with the Prophet (ﷺ) and we carried on traveling till the last part of the night and 
then we (halted at a place) and slept (deeply). There is nothing sweeter than sleep for a traveler in the 
last part of the night. So it was only the heat of the sun that made us to wake up and the first to wake 
up was so and so, then so and so and then so and so (the narrator `Auf said that Abu Raja' had told 
him their names but he had forgotten them) and the fourth person to wake up was `Umar bin Al- 
Khattab. And whenever the Prophet (ﷺ) used to sleep, nobody would wake up him till he himself used to 
get up as we did not know what was happening (being revealed) to him in his sleep. So, `Umar got up 
and saw the condition of the people, and he was a strict man, so he said, ""Allahu Akbar"" and raised his 
voice with Takbir, and kept on saying loudly till the Prophet (ﷺ) got up because of it. When he got up, the 
people informed him about what had happened to them. He said, ""There is no harm (or it will not be 
harmful). Depart!"" So they departed from that place, and after covering some distance the Prophet (ﷺ) 
stopped and asked for some water to perform the ablution. So he performed the ablution and the call 
for the prayer was pronounced and he led the people in prayer. After he finished from the prayer, he 
saw a man sitting aloof who had not prayed with the people. He asked, ""O so and so! What has 
prevented you from praying with us?"" He replied, ""I am Junub and there is no water. "" The Prophet (ﷺ) 
said, ""Perform Tayammum with (clean) earth and that is sufficient for you."" 
Then the Prophet (ﷺ) proceeded on and the people complained to him of thirst. Thereupon he got down 
and called a person (the narrator `Auf added that Abu Raja' had named him but he had forgotten) and 
`Ali, and ordered them to go and bring water. So they went in search of water and met a woman who 
was sitting on her camel between two bags of water. They asked, ""Where can we find water?"" She 
replied, ""I was there (at the place of water) this hour yesterday and my people are behind me."" They 
requested her to accompany them. She asked, ""Where?"" They said, ""To Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) ."" She said, 
""Do you mean the man who is called the Sabi, (with a new religion)?"" They replied, ""Yes, the same 
person. So come along."" They brought her to the Prophet (ﷺ) and narrated the whole story. He said, ""Help 
her to dismount."" The Prophet (ﷺ) asked for a pot, then he opened the mouths of the bags and poured 
some water into the pot. Then he closed the big openings of the bags and opened the small ones and 
the people were called upon to drink and water their animals. 
So they all watered their animals and they (too) all quenched their thirst and also gave water to others 
and last of all the Prophet (ﷺ) gave a pot full of water to the person who was Junub and told him to pour it 
over his body. The woman was standing and watching all that which they were doing with her water. 
By Allah, when her water bags were returned the looked like as if they were more full (of water) than 
they had been before (Miracle of Allah's Messenger) Then the Prophet (ﷺ) ordered us to collect something 
for her; so dates, flour and Sawiq were collected which amounted to a good meal that was put in a 
piece of cloth. She was helped to ride on her camel and that cloth full of foodstuff was also placed in 
front of her and then the Prophet (ﷺ) said to her, ""We have not taken your water but Allah has given water 
to us."" She returned home late. Her relatives asked her: ""O so and so what has delayed you?"" She said, 
""A strange thing! Two men met me and took me to the man who is called the Sabi' and he did such 
and such a thing. By Allah, he is either the greatest magician between this and this (gesturing with her 
index and middle fingers raising them towards the sky indicating the heaven and the earth) or he is 
Allah's true Apostle."" 
Afterwards the Muslims used to attack the pagans around her abode but never touched her village. 
One day she said to her people, ""I think that these people leave you purposely. Have you got any 
inclination to Islam?"" They obeyed her and all of them embraced Islam.

Abu Barza had said about the Maghrib prayer), and the Prophet (ﷺ) preferred to pray the `Isha' late and 
disliked to sleep before it or talk after it. And he used to return after finishing the morning prayer at

`Isha' prayer was offered. Abu Bakr went back and stayed with the Prophet (ﷺ) till the Prophet (ﷺ) took his 
meal and then Abu Bakr returned to his house after a long portion of the night had passed. Abu Bakr's 
wife said, 'What detained you from your guests (or guest)?' He said, 'Have you not served them yet?' 
She said, 'They refused to eat until you come. The food was served for them but they refused."" `Abdur 
Rahman added, ""I went away and hid myself (being afraid of Abu Bakr) and in the meantime he (Abu 
Bakr) called me, 'O Ghunthar (a harsh word)!' and also called me bad names and abused me and then 
said (to his family), 'Eat. No welcome for you.' Then (the supper was served). Abu Bakr took an oath 
that he would not eat that food. The narrator added: By Allah, whenever any one of us (myself and the 
guests of Suffa companions) took anything from the food, it increased from underneath. We all ate to 
our fill and the food was more than it was before its serving. 
Abu Bakr looked at it (the food) and found it as it was before serving or even more than that. He 
addressed his wife (saying) 'O the sister of Bani Firas! What is this?' She said, 'O the pleasure of my 
eyes! The food is now three times more than it was before.' Abu Bakr ate from it, and said, 'That 
(oath) was from Satan' meaning his oath (not to eat). Then he again took a morsel (mouthful) from it 
and then took the rest of it to the Prophet. So that meal was with the Prophet. There was a treaty 
between us and some people, and when the period of that treaty had elapsed the Prophet (ﷺ) divided us

the Prophet (ﷺ) was delivering the Khutba on a Friday, a Bedouin stood up and said, ""O, Allah's Messenger! 
Our possessions are being destroyed and the children are hungry; Please invoke Allah (for rain)"". So 
the Prophet (ﷺ) raised his hands. At that time there was not a trace of cloud in the sky. By Him in Whose 
Hands my soul is as soon as he lowered his hands, clouds gathered like mountains, and before he got 
down from the pulpit, I saw the rain falling on the beard of the Prophet. It rained that day, the next 
day, the third day, the fourth day till the next Friday. The same Bedouin or another man stood up and 
said, ""O Allah's Messenger! The houses have collapsed, our possessions and livestock have been 
drowned; Please invoke Allah (to protect us)"". So the Prophet (ﷺ) raised both his hands and said, ""O 
Allah! Round about us and not on us"". So, in whatever direction he pointed with his hands, the clouds 
dispersed and cleared away, and Medina's (sky) became clear as a hole in between the clouds. The

So, we performed Tawaf round the Ka'bah and [Sa'y] between As-safa and Al-MArwa, slept with our wives and wore ordinary (stitched) clothes.

He must slaughter a Hady such as he can afford, but if he cannot afford it, he should observer Saum (fasts) three days during the Hajj and seven days after his return (to his home)…."" (V. 2:196).And the sacrifice of the sheep is sufficient. So, the Prophet (ﷺ) and his Companions joined the two religious deeds, (i.e. Hajj and 'Umra) in one year, for Allah revealed (the permissibility) of such practice in His book and in the Sunna (legal ways) of His Prophet (ﷺ) and rendered it permissible for all the people except those living in Makkah.

The Prophet (ﷺ) and his companions assumed Ihram for Hajj and none except the Prophet (ﷺ) and Talha had 
the Hadi with them. `Ali had come from Yemen and he had the Hadi with him. He (`Ali) said, ""I have 
assumed Ihram with an intention like that of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) has assumed it."" The Prophet (ﷺ) ordered his 
companions to intend the Ihram with which they had come for `Umra, to perform the Tawaf of the 
Ka`ba (and between Safa and Marwa), to get their hair cut short and then to finish their Ihram with the 
exception of those who had the Hadi with them. They asked, ""Shall we go to Mina and the private 
organs of some of us are dribbling (if we finish Ihram and have sexual relations with our wives)?"" The 
Prophet heard that and said, ""Had I known what I know now, I would not have brought the Hadi. If I 
did not have the Hadi with me I would have finished my Ihram."" `Aisha got her menses and 
performed all the ceremonies (of Hajj) except the Tawaf . So when she became clean from her 
menses, and she had performed the Tawaf of the Ka`ba, she said, ""O Allah's Messenger! You (people) 
are returning with both Hajj and `Umra and I am returning only with Hajj!"" So, he ordered `Abdur 
Rahman bin Abu Bakr to go with her to at-Tan`im. Thus she performed `Umra after the Hajj in the 
month of Dhi-l-Hijja. Suraqa bin Malik bin Ju'sham met the Prophet (ﷺ) at Al-`Aqaba (Jamrat-ul 'Aqaba) 
while the latter was stoning it and said, ""O Allah's Messenger! Is this permissible only for you?"" The 
Prophet replied, ""No, it is for ever (i.e. it is permissible for all Muslims to perform `Umra before 
Hajj.""",,Sahih

said, ""Whoever wants to assume Ihram for `Umra may do so, and whoever wants to assume Ihram for 
Hajj may do so. Had not I brought the Hadi with me, I would have assumed Ihram for `Umra."" Some 
of the people assumed Ihram for `Umra while others for Hajj. I was amongst those who had assumed 
Ihram for `Umra. I got my menses before entering Mecca, and was menstruating till the day of 
`Arafat. I complained to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) about it, he said, ""Abandon your `Umra, undo and comb your 
hair, and assume Ihram for Hajj."" So, I did that accordingly. When it was the night of Hasba (day of 
departure from Mina), the Prophet (ﷺ) sent `Abdur Rahman with me to at-Tan`im.

`Umra in lieu of the abandoned one. Aisha completed her Hajj and `Umra, and no Hadi, Sadaqa

The Prophet (ﷺ) and some of his wealthy companions had the Hadi with them, so they did not finish 
Ihram after performing the `Umra. The Prophet (ﷺ) came to me while I was weeping. He asked me the 
reason for it. I replied, ""I have heard of what you have said to your companions and I cannot do the 
`Umra."" He asked me, ""What is the matter with you?"" I replied, ""I am not praying."" He said, ""There is 
no harm in it as you are one of the daughters of Adam and the same is written for you as for others. 
So, you should perform Hajj and I hope that Allah will enable you to perform the `Umra as well."" So, 
I carried on till we departed from Mina and halted at Al-Mahassab. The Prophet (ﷺ) called `Abdur-

after both of you have finished the Tawaf I will be waiting for you at this place."" We came back at 
midnight and the Prophet (ﷺ) asked us, ""Have you finished?"" I replied in the affirmative. He announced

wished to see the Prophet (ﷺ) being divinely inspired. `Umar said to me, 'Come! Will you be pleased to

was put beside a place called Qudaid and those people thought it not right to perform the Tawaf of As-

 of wood and made a hole in it, inserted in it one thousand Dinars and 
 a letter to the lender and then closed (i.e. sealed) the hole tightly.

 a surety from me but I told him that Allah's Guarantee was sufficient

 him that Allah was sufficient as a Witness, and he accepted You as a 
 Witness. No doubt, I tried hard to find a conveyance so that I could 
 pay his money but could not find, so I hand over this money to You.'

 far into it, and then he went away. Meanwhile he started searching for
 a conveyance in order to reach the creditor's country.

 I could bring you your money, but failed to get one before the one I 
 have come by.' The lender asked, 'Have you sent something to me?' The

(wife of the Prophet) Since I reached the age when I could remember things, I have seen my parents 
worshipping according to the right faith of Islam. Not a single day passed but Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) visited 
us both in the morning and in the evening. When the Muslims were persecuted, Abu Bakr set out for 
Ethiopia as an emigrant. When he reached a place called Bark-al-Ghimad, he met Ibn Ad-Daghna, the 
chief of the Qara tribe, who asked Abu Bakr, ""Where are you going?"" Abu Bakr said, ""My people 
have turned me out of the country and I would like to tour the world and worship my Lord."" Ibn Ad- 
Daghna said, ""A man like you will not go out, nor will he be turned out as you help the poor earn their 
living, keep good relation with your Kith and kin, help the disabled (or the dependents), provide 
guests with food and shelter, and help people during their troubles. I am your protector. So, go back 
and worship your Lord at your home."" Ibn Ad-Daghna went along with Abu Bakr and took him to the 
chiefs of Quraish saying to them, ""A man like Abu Bakr will not go out, nor will he be turned out. Do 
you turn out a man who helps the poor earn their living, keeps good relations with Kith and kin, helps 
the disabled, provides guests with food and shelter, and helps the people during their troubles?"" 
So, Quraish allowed Ibn Ad-Daghna's guarantee of protection and told Abu- Bakr that he was secure, 
and said to Ibn Ad-Daghna, ""Advise Abu Bakr to worship his Lord in his house and to pray and read 
what he liked and not to hurt us and not to do these things publicly, for we fear that our sons and 
women may follow him."" Ibn Ad-Daghna told Abu Bakr of all that, so Abu- Bakr continued 
worshipping his Lord in his house and did not pray or recite Qur'an aloud except in his house. Later 
on Abu Bakr had an idea of building a mosque in the court yard of his house. He fulfilled that idea and 
started praying and reciting Qur'an there publicly. The women and the offspring of the pagans started 
gathering around him and looking at him astonishingly. Abu Bakr was a softhearted person and could 
not help weeping while reciting Qur'an. This horrified the pagan chiefs of Quraish. They sent for Ibn 
Ad-Daghna and when he came, they said, ""We have given Abu Bakr protection on condition that he 
will worship his Lord in his house, but he has transgressed that condition and has built a mosque in 
the court yard of his house and offered his prayer and recited Qur'an in public. We are afraid lest he 
mislead our women and offspring. So, go to him and tell him that if he wishes he can worship his 
Lord in his house only, and if not, then tell him to return your pledge of protection as we do not like to 
betray you by revoking your pledge, nor can we tolerate Abu Bakr's public declaration of Islam (his 
worshipping). 
`Aisha added: Ibn Ad-Daghna came to Abu Bakr and said, ""You know the conditions on which I gave 
you protection, so you should either abide by those conditions or revoke my protection, as I do not 
like to hear the 'Arabs saying that Ibn Ad-Daghna gave the pledge of protection to a person and his 
people did not respect it."" Abu Bakr said, ""I revoke your pledge of protection and am satisfied with 
Allah's protection."" At that time Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) was still in Mecca and he said to his companions, 
""Your place of emigration has been shown to me. I have seen salty land, planted with date-palms and 
situated between two mountains which are the two ,Harras."" So, when the Prophet (ﷺ) told it, some of the 
companions migrated to Medina, and some of those who had migrated to Ethiopia returned to Medina. 
When Abu Bakr prepared for emigration, Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said to him, ""Wait, for I expect to be 
permitted to emigrate."" Abu Bakr asked, ""May my father be sacrificed for your sake, do you really 
expect that?"" Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) replied in the affirmative. So, Abu Bakr postponed his departure in order 
to accompany Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and fed two camels which he had, with the leaves of Samor trees for 
four months.",,Sahih

emigrant brethren were busy trading in the markets, and my Ansar brethren were busy with their

filled my stomach. So, I used to be present while they (i.e. the emigrants and the Ansar) were absent,

his sheet till I finish this statement of mine and then gathers it on his chest, will never forget anything

finished his statement and then I gathered it over my chest. By Him Who had sent him (i.e. Allah's 
Apostle) with the truth, since then I did not forget even a single word of that statement of his, until this

I had been eager to ask `Umar about the two ladies from among the wives of the Prophet (ﷺ) regarding 
whom Allah said (in the Qur'an saying): If you two (wives of the Prophet (ﷺ) namely Aisha and Hafsa) 
turn in repentance to Allah your hearts are indeed so inclined (to oppose what the Prophet (ﷺ) likes) 
(66.4), till performed the Hajj along with `Umar (and on our way back from Hajj) he went aside (to 
answer the call of nature) and I also went aside along with him carrying a tumbler of water. When he 
had answered the call of nature and returned. I poured water on his hands from the tumbler and he 
performed ablution. I said, ""O Chief of the believers! ' Who were the two ladies from among the wives 
of the Prophet (ﷺ) to whom Allah said: 
'If you two return in repentance (66.4)? He said, ""I am astonished at your question, O Ibn `Abbas. 
They were Aisha and Hafsa."" 
Then `Umar went on relating the narration and said. ""I and an Ansari neighbor of mine from Bani 
Umaiya bin Zaid who used to live in `Awali Al-Medina, used to visit the Prophet (ﷺ) in turns. He used to 
go one day, and I another day. When I went I would bring him the news of what had happened that 
day regarding the instructions and orders and when he went, he used to do the same for me. We, the 
people of Quraish, used to have authority over women, but when we came to live with the Ansar, we 
noticed that the Ansari women had the upper hand over their men, so our women started acquiring the 
habits of the Ansari women. Once I shouted at my wife and she paid me back in my coin and I 
disliked that she should answer me back. She said, 'Why do you take it ill that I retort upon you? By 
Allah, the wives of the Prophet (ﷺ) retort upon him, and some of them may not speak with him for the 
whole day till night.' What she said scared me and I said to her, 'Whoever amongst them does so, will 
be a great loser.' Then I dressed myself and went to Hafsa and asked her, 'Does any of you keep 
Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) angry all the day long till night?' She replied in the affirmative. I said, 'She is a ruined 
losing person (and will never have success)! Doesn't she fear that Allah may get angry for the anger of 
Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and thus she will be ruined? Don't ask Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) too many things, and don't 
retort upon him in any case, and don't desert him. Demand from me whatever you like, and don't be 
tempted to imitate your neighbor (i.e. `Aisha) in her behavior towards the Prophet), for she (i.e. Aisha) 
is more beautiful than you, and more beloved to Allah's Messenger. 
In those days it was rumored that Ghassan, (a tribe living in Sham) was getting prepared their horses 
to invade us. My companion went (to the Prophet (ﷺ) on the day of his turn, went and returned to us at 
night and knocked at my door violently, asking whether I was sleeping. I was scared (by the hard 
knocking) and came out to him. He said that a great thing had happened. I asked him: What is it? 
Have Ghassan come? He replied that it was worse and more serious than that, and added that Allah's 
Apostle had divorced all his wives. I said, Hafsa is a ruined loser! I expected that would happen some 
day.' So I dressed myself and offered the Fajr prayer with the Prophet. Then the Prophet (ﷺ) entered an 
upper room and stayed there alone. I went to Hafsa and found her weeping. I asked her, 'Why are you 
weeping? Didn't I warn you? Have Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) divorced you all?' She replied, 'I don't know. He is 
there in the upper room.' I then went out and came to the pulpit and found a group of people around it 
and some of them were weeping. 
Then I sat with them for some time, but could not endure the situation. So I went to the upper room 
where the Prophet (ﷺ) was and requested to a black slave of his: ""Will you get the permission of (Allah's 
Apostle) for `Umar (to enter)? The slave went in, talked to the Prophet (ﷺ) about it and came out saying, 'I 
mentioned you to him but he did not reply.' So, I went and sat with the people who were sitting by the 
pulpit, but I could not bear the situation, so I went to the slave again and said: ""Will you get he 
permission for `Umar? He went in and brought the same reply as before. When I was leaving, behold, 
the slave called me saying, ""Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) has granted you permission."" So, I entered upon the 
Prophet and saw him lying on a mat without wedding on it, and the mat had left its mark on the body 
of the Prophet, and he was leaning on a leather pillow stuffed with palm fires. I greeted him and while 
still standing, I said: ""Have you divorced your wives?' He raised his eyes to me and replied in the 
negative. 
And then while still standing, I said chatting: ""Will you heed what I say, 'O Allah's Messenger! We, the 
people of Quraish used to have the upper hand over our women (wives), and when we came to the 
people whose women had the upper hand over them..."" 
`Umar told the whole story (about his wife). ""On that the Prophet (ﷺ) smiled."" `Umar further said, ""I then 
said, 'I went to Hafsa and said to her: Do not be tempted to imitate your companion (`Aisha) for she is 
more beautiful than you and more beloved to the Prophet.' The Prophet (ﷺ) smiled again. When I saw him 
smiling, I sat down and cast a glance at the room, and by Allah, I couldn't see anything of importance 
but three hides. I said (to Allah's Messenger) ""Invoke Allah to make your followers prosperous for the 
Persians and the Byzantines have been made prosperous and given worldly luxuries, though they do 
not worship Allah?' The Prophet (ﷺ) was leaning then (and on hearing my speech he sat straight) and said, 
'O Ibn Al-Khattab! Do you have any doubt (that the Hereafter is better than this world)? These people 
have been given rewards of their good deeds in this world only.' I asked the Prophet (ﷺ) . 'Please ask 
Allah's forgiveness for me. 
The Prophet (ﷺ) did not go to his wives because of the secret which Hafsa had disclosed to `Aisha, and he 
said that he would not go to his wives for one month as he was angry with them when Allah 
admonished him (for his oath that he would not approach Maria). When twenty-nine days had passed, 
the Prophet (ﷺ) went to Aisha first of all. She said to him, 'You took an oath that you would not come to 
us for one month, and today only twenty-nine days have passed, as I have been counting them day by 
day.' The Prophet (ﷺ) said, 'The month is also of twenty-nine days.' That month consisted of twenty-nine 
days. `Aisha said, 'When the Divine revelation of Choice was revealed, the Prophet (ﷺ) started with me, 
saying to me, 'I am telling you something, but you need not hurry to give the reply till you can consult 
your parents."" `Aisha knew that her parents would not advise her to part with the Prophet (ﷺ) . 
The Prophet (ﷺ) said that Allah had said: 'O Prophet! Say To your wives; If you desire The life of this 
world And its glitter, ... then come! I will make a provision for you and set you free In a handsome 
manner. But if you seek Allah And His Apostle, and The Home of the Hereafter, then Verily, Allah 
has prepared For the good-doers amongst you A great reward.' (33.28) `Aisha said, 'Am I to consult 
my parents about this? I indeed prefer Allah, His Apostle, and the Home of the Hereafter.' After that 
the Prophet (ﷺ) gave the choice to his other wives and they also gave the same reply as `Aisha did.""",,Sahih

(the wife of the Prophet) ""Whenever Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) intended to go on a journey, he would draw lots 
amongst his wives and would take with him the one upon whom the lot fell. During a Ghazwa of his, 
he drew lots amongst us and the lot fell upon me, and I proceeded with him after Allah had decreed 
the use of the veil by women. I was carried in a Howdah (on the camel) and dismounted while still in 
it. When Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) was through with his Ghazwa and returned home, and we approached the 
city of Medina, Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) ordered us to proceed at night. When the order of setting off was 
given, I walked till I was past the army to answer the call of nature. After finishing I returned (to the 
camp) to depart (with the others) and suddenly realized that my necklace over my chest was missing. 
So, I returned to look for it and was delayed because of that. The people who used to carry me on the 
camel, came to my Howdah and put it on the back of the camel, thinking that I was in it, as, at that 
time, women were light in weight, and thin and lean, and did not use to eat much. So, those people did 
not feel the difference in the heaviness of the Howdah while lifting it, and they put it over the camel. 
At that time I was a young lady. They set the camel moving and proceeded on. I found my necklace 
after the army had gone, and came to their camp to find nobody. So, I went to the place where I used 
to stay, thinking that they would discover my absence and come back in my search. While in that 
state, I felt sleepy and slept. 
Safwan bin Mu'attal As-Sulami Adh-Dhakwani was behind the army and reached my abode in the 
morning. When he saw a sleeping person, he came to me, and he used to see me before veiling. So, I 
got up when I heard him saying, ""Inna lil-lah-wa inn a ilaihi rajiun (We are for Allah, and we will 
return to Him)."" He made his camel knell down. He got down from his camel, and put his leg on the 
front legs of the camel and then I rode and sat over it. Safwan set out walking, leading the camel by 
the rope till we reached the army who had halted to take rest at midday. Then whoever was meant for 
destruction, fell into destruction, (some people accused me falsely) and the leader of the false accusers 
was `Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul. After that we returned to Medina, and I became ill for one month 
while the people were spreading the forged statements of the false accusers. I was feeling during my 
ailment as if I were not receiving the usual kindness from the Prophet (ﷺ) which I used to receive from 
him when I got sick. But he would come, greet and say, 'How is that (girl)?' I did not know anything 
of what was going on till I recovered from my ailment and went out with Um Mistah to the Manasi 
where we used to answer the call of nature, and we used not to go to answer the call of nature except 
from night to night and that was before we had lavatories near to our houses. And this habit of ours 
was similar to the habit of the old 'Arabs in the open country (or away from houses). So. I and Um 
Mistah bint Ruhm went out walking. Um Mistah stumbled because of her long dress and on that she 
said, 'Let Mistah be ruined.' I said, 'You are saying a bad word. Why are you abusing a man who took 
part in (the battle of) Badr?' She said, 'O Hanata (you there) didn't you hear what they said?' Then she 
told me the rumors of the false accusers. 
My sickness was aggravated, and when I returned home, Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) came to me, and after 
greeting he said, 'How is that (girl)?' I requested him to allow me to go to my parents. I wanted then to 
be sure of the news through them I Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) allowed me, and I went to my parents and asked 
my mother, 'What are the people talking about?' She said, 'O my daughter! Don't worry much about 
this matter. By Allah, never is there a charming woman loved by her husband who has other wives, 
but the women would forge false news about her.' I said, 'Glorified be Allah! Are the people really 
taking of this matter?' That night I kept on weeping and could not sleep till morning. In the morning 
Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) called `Ali bin Abu Talib and Usama bin Zaid when he saw the Divine Inspiration 
delayed, to consul them about divorcing his wife (i.e. `Aisha). Usama bin Zaid said what he knew of 
the good reputation of his wives and added, 'O Allah's Messenger! Keep you wife, for, by Allah, we 
know nothing about her but good.' `Ali bin Abu Talib said, 'O Allah's Messenger! Allah has no imposed 
restrictions on you, and there are many women other than she, yet you may ask the woman-servant 
who will tell you the truth.' On that Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) called Barirah and said, 'O Barirah. Did you ever 
see anything which roused your suspicions about her?' Barirah said, 'No, by Allah Who has sent you 
with the Truth, I have never seen in her anything faulty except that she is a girl of immature age, who 
sometimes sleeps and leaves the dough for the goats to eat.' On that day Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) ascended the 
pulpit and requested that somebody support him in punishing `Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul. Allah's 
Apostle said, 'Who will support me to punish that person (`Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul) who has hurt 
me by slandering the reputation of my family? By Allah, I know nothing about my family but good, 
and they have accused a person about whom I know nothing except good, and he never entered my 
house except in my company.' 
Sa`d bin Mu`adh got up and said, 'O Allah's Messenger! by Allah, I will relieve you from him. If that 
man is from the tribe of the Aus, then we will chop his head off, and if he is from our brothers, the 
Khazraj, then order us, and we will fulfill your order.' On that Sa`d bin 'Ubada, the chief of the 
Khazraj and before this incident, he had been a pious man, got up, motivated by his zeal for his tribe 
and said, 'By Allah, you have told a lie; you cannot kill him, and you will never be able to kill him.' 
On that Usaid bin Al-Hadir got up and said (to Sa`d bin 'Ubada), 'By Allah! you are a liar. By Allah, 
we will kill him; and you are a hypocrite, defending the hypocrites.' On this the two tribes of Aus and 
Khazraj got excited and were about to fight each other, while Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) was standing on the 
pulpit. He got down and quieted them till they became silent and he kept quiet. On that day I kept on 
weeping so much so that neither did my tears stop, nor could I sleep. 
In the morning my parents were with me and I had wept for two nights and a day, till I thought my 
liver would burst from weeping. While they were sitting with me and I was weeping, an Ansari 
woman asked my permission to enter, and I allowed her to come in. She sat down and started weeping 
with me. While we were in this state, Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) came and sat down and he had never sat with me 
since the day they forged the accusation. No revelation regarding my case came to him for a month. 
He recited Tashah-hud (i.e. None has the right to be worshipped but Allah and Muhammad is His 
Apostle) and then said, 'O `Aisha! I have been informed such-and-such about you; if you are innocent, 
then Allah will soon reveal your innocence, and if you have committed a sin, then repent to Allah and 
ask Him to forgive you, for when a person confesses his sin and asks Allah for forgiveness, Allah 
accepts his repentance.' When Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) finished his speech my tears ceased completely and 
there remained not even a single drop of it. I requested my father to reply to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) on my 
behalf. My father said, By Allah, I do not know what to say to Allah's Messenger.' I said to my mother, 
'Talk to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) on my behalf.' She said, 'By Allah, I do not know what to say to Allah's 
Apostle. 
I was a young girl and did not have much knowledge of the Qur'an. I said. 'I know, by Allah, that you 
have listened to what people are saying and that has been planted in your minds and you have taken it 
as a truth. Now, if I told you that I am innocent and Allah knows that I am innocent, you would not 
believe me and if I confessed to you falsely that I am guilty, and Allah knows that I am innocent you 
would believe me. By Allah, I don't compare my situation with you except to the situation of Joseph's 
father (i.e. Jacob) who said, 'So (for me) patience is most fitting against that which you assert and it is 
Allah (Alone) whose help can be sought.' Then I turned to the other side of my bed hoping that Allah 
would prove my innocence. By Allah I never thought that Allah would reveal Divine Inspiration in 
my case, as I considered myself too inferior to be talked of in the Holy Qur'an. I had hoped that 
Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) might have a dream in which Allah would prove my innocence. By Allah, Allah's 
Apostle had not got up and nobody had left the house before the Divine Inspiration came to Allah's 
Apostle. So, there overtook him the same state which used to overtake him, (when he used to have, on 
being inspired divinely). He was sweating so much so that the drops of the sweat were dropping like 
pearls though it was a (cold) wintry day. When that state of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) was over, he was smiling 
and the first word he said, `Aisha! Thank Allah, for Allah has declared your innocence.' My mother 
told me to go to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) . I replied, 'By Allah I will not go to him and will not thank but Allah.' 
So Allah revealed: ""Verily! They who spread the slander are a gang among you . . ."" (24.11) 
When Allah gave the declaration of my Innocence, Abu Bakr, who used to provide for Mistah bin 
Uthatha for he was his relative, said, 'By Allah, I will never provide Mistah with anything because of 
what he said about Aisha.' But Allah later revealed: -- 
""And let not those who are good and wealthy among you swear not to help their kinsmen, those in 
need and those who left their homes in Allah's Cause. Let them forgive and overlook. Do you not wish 
that Allah should forgive you? Verily! Allah is Oft-forgiving, Most Merciful."" (24.22) After that Abu 
Bakr said, 'Yes ! By Allah! I like that Allah should forgive me,' and resumed helping Mistah whom he 
used to help before. 
Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) also asked Zainab bint Jahsh (i.e. the Prophet's wife about me saying, 'What do you 
know and what did you see?' She replied, 'O Allah's Messenger! I refrain to claim hearing or seeing what 
I have not heard or seen. By Allah, I know nothing except goodness about Aisha."" Aisha further added 
""Zainab was competing with me (in her beauty and the Prophet's love), yet Allah protected her (from 
being malicious), for she had piety.""",,Sahih

money.",,Sahih

"bukhari2731, 2732",bukhari,54,Bukhari,15,"2731, 2732","Narrated Al-Miswar bin Makhrama and Marwan:

(whose narrations attest each other) Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) set out at the time of Al-Hudaibiya (treaty), and 
when they proceeded for a distance, he said, ""Khalid bin Al-Walid leading the cavalry of Quraish 
constituting the front of the army, is at a place called Al-Ghamim, so take the way on the right."" By 
Allah, Khalid did not perceive the arrival of the Muslims till the dust arising from the march of the 
Muslim army reached him, and then he turned back hurriedly to inform Quraish. The Prophet (ﷺ) went on 
advancing till he reached the Thaniya (i.e. a mountainous way) through which one would go to them 
(i.e. people of Quraish). The she-camel of the Prophet (ﷺ) sat down. The people tried their best to cause 
the she-camel to get up but in vain, so they said, ""Al-Qaswa' (i.e. the she-camel's name) has become 
stubborn! Al-Qaswa' has become stubborn!"" The Prophet (ﷺ) said, ""Al-Qaswa' has not become stubborn, 
for stubbornness is not her habit, but she was stopped by Him Who stopped the elephant."" Then he 
said, ""By the Name of Him in Whose Hands my soul is, if they (i.e. the Quraish infidels) ask me 
anything which will respect the ordinances of Allah, I will grant it to them."" 
The Prophet (ﷺ) then rebuked the she-camel and she got up. The Prophet (ﷺ) changed his way till he 
dismounted at the farthest end of Al-Hudaibiya at a pit (i.e. well) containing a little water which the 
people used in small amounts, and in a short while the people used up all its water and complained to 
Allah's Messenger; of thirst. The Prophet (ﷺ) took an arrow out of his arrow-case and ordered them to put the 
arrow in that pit. By Allah, the water started and continued sprouting out till all the people quenched 
their thirst and returned with satisfaction. While they were still in that state, Budail bin Warqa-al- 
Khuza`i came with some persons from his tribe Khuza`a and they were the advisers of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) 
who would keep no secret from him and were from the people of Tihama. Budail said, ""I left Ka`b bin 
Luai and 'Amir bin Luai residing at the profuse water of Al-Hudaibiya and they had milch camels (or 
their women and children) with them, and will wage war against you, and will prevent you from 
visiting the Ka`ba."" 
Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said, ""We have not come to fight anyone, but to perform the `Umra. No doubt, the war 
has weakened Quraish and they have suffered great losses, so if they wish, I will conclude a truce with 
them, during which they should refrain from interfering between me and the people (i.e. the 'Arab 
infidels other than Quraish), and if I have victory over those infidels, Quraish will have the option to 
embrace Islam as the other people do, if they wish; they will at least get strong enough to fight. But if 
they do not accept the truce, by Allah in Whose Hands my life is, I will fight with them defending my 
Cause till I get killed, but (I am sure) Allah will definitely make His Cause victorious."" Budail said, ""I 
will inform them of what you have said."" So, he set off till he reached Quraish and said, ""We have 
come from that man (i.e. Muhammad) whom we heard saying something which we will disclose to 
you if you should like."" Some of the fools among Quraish shouted that they were not in need of this 
information, but the wiser among them said, ""Relate what you heard him saying."" Budail said, ""I 
heard him saying so-and-so,"" relating what the Prophet (ﷺ) had told him. 
`Urwa bin Mas`ud got up and said, ""O people! Aren't you the sons? They said, ""Yes."" He added, ""Am 
I not the father?"" They said, ""Yes."" He said, ""Do you mistrust me?"" They said, ""No."" He said, ""Don't 
you know that I invited the people of `Ukaz for your help, and when they refused I brought my 
relatives and children and those who obeyed me (to help you)?"" They said, ""Yes."" He said, ""Well, this 
man (i.e. the Prophet) has offered you a reasonable proposal, you'd better accept it and allow me to 
meet him."" They said, ""You may meet him."" So, he went to the Prophet (ﷺ) and started talking to him. 
The Prophet (ﷺ) told him almost the same as he had told Budail. Then `Urwa said, ""O Muhammad! Won't 
you feel any scruple in extirpating your relations? Have you ever heard of anyone amongst the Arabs 
extirpating his relatives before you? On the other hand, if the reverse should happen, (nobody will aid 
you, for) by Allah, I do not see (with you) dignified people, but people from various tribes who would 
run away leaving you alone."" Hearing that, Abu Bakr abused him and said, ""Do you say we would run 
and leave the Prophet (ﷺ) alone?"" `Urwa said, ""Who is that man?"" They said, ""He is Abu Bakr."" `Urwa 
said to Abu Bakr, ""By Him in Whose Hands my life is, were it not for the favor which you did to me 
and which I did not compensate, I would retort on you."" `Urwa kept on talking to the Prophet (ﷺ) and 
seizing the Prophet's beard as he was talking while Al-Mughira bin Shu`ba was standing near the head 
of the Prophet, holding a sword and wearing a helmet. Whenever `Urwa stretched his hand towards 
the beard of the Prophet, Al-Mughira would hit his hand with the handle of the sword and say (to 
`Urwa), ""Remove your hand from the beard of Allah's Messenger."" `Urwa raised his head and asked, 
""Who is that?"" The people said, ""He is Al-Mughira bin Shu`ba."" `Urwa said, ""O treacherous! Am I not 
doing my best to prevent evil consequences of your treachery?"" 
Before embracing Islam Al-Mughira was in the company of some people. He killed them and took 
their property and came (to Medina) to embrace Islam. The Prophet (ﷺ) said (to him, ""As regards your 
Islam, I accept it, but as for the property I do not take anything of it. (As it was taken through treason). 
`Urwa then started looking at the Companions of the Prophet. By Allah, whenever Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) 
spat, the spittle would fall in the hand of one of them (i.e. the Prophet's companions) who would rub it 
on his face and skin; if he ordered them they would carry his orders immediately; if he performed 
ablution, they would struggle to take the remaining water; and when they spoke to him, they would 
lower their voices and would not look at his face constantly out of respect. `Urwa returned to his 
people and said, ""O people! By Allah, I have been to the kings and to Caesar, Khosrau and An- 
Najashi, yet I have never seen any of them respected by his courtiers as much as Muhammad is 
respected by his companions. 
By Allah, if he spat, the spittle would fall in the hand of one of them (i.e. the Prophet's companions) 
who would rub it on his face and skin; if he ordered them, they would carry out his order immediately; 
if he performed ablution, they would struggle to take the remaining water; and when they spoke, they 
would lower their voices and would not look at his face constantly out of respect."" `Urwa added, ""No 
doubt, he has presented to you a good reasonable offer, so please accept it."" A man from the tribe of 
Bani Kinana said, ""Allow me to go to him,"" and they allowed him, and when he approached the 
Prophet and his companions, Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said, ""He is so-and-so who belongs to the tribe that 
respects the Budn (i.e. camels of the sacrifice). 
So, bring the Budn in front of him."" So, the Budn were brought before him and the people received 
him while they were reciting Talbiya. When he saw that scene, he said, ""Glorified be Allah! It is not 
fair to prevent these people from visiting the Ka`ba."" When he returned to his people, he said, 'I saw 
the Budn garlanded (with colored knotted ropes) and marked (with stabs on their backs). I do not think 
it is advisable to prevent them from visiting the Ka`ba."" Another person called Mikraz bin Hafs got up 
and sought their permission to go to Muhammad, and they allowed him, too. When he approached the 
Muslims, the Prophet (ﷺ) said, ""Here is Mikraz and he is a vicious man."" Mikraz started talking to the 
Prophet and as he was talking, Suhail bin `Amr came. 
When Suhail bin `Amr came, the Prophet (ﷺ) said, ""Now the matter has become easy."" Suhail said to the 
Prophet ""Please conclude a peace treaty with us."" So, the Prophet (ﷺ) called the clerk and said to him, 
""Write: By the Name of Allah, the most Beneficent, the most Merciful."" Suhail said, ""As for 
'Beneficent,' by Allah, I do not know what it means. So write: By Your Name O Allah, as you used to 
write previously."" The Muslims said, ""By Allah, we will not write except: By the Name of Allah, the 
most Beneficent, the most Merciful."" The Prophet (ﷺ) said, ""Write: By Your Name O Allah."" Then he 
dictated, ""This is the peace treaty which Muhammad, Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) has concluded."" Suhail said, ""By 
Allah, if we knew that you are Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) we would not prevent you from visiting the Ka`ba, and 
would not fight with you. So, write: ""Muhammad bin `Abdullah."" The Prophet (ﷺ) said, ""By Allah! I am 
Apostle of Allah even if you people do not believe me. Write: Muhammad bin `Abdullah."" 
(Az-Zuhri said, ""The Prophet (ﷺ) accepted all those things, as he had already said that he would accept 
everything they would demand if it respects the ordinance of Allah, (i.e. by letting him and his 
companions perform `Umra.)"" The Prophet (ﷺ) said to Suhail, ""On the condition that you allow us to visit 
the House (i.e. Ka`ba) so that we may perform Tawaf around it."" Suhail said, ""By Allah, we will not 
(allow you this year) so as not to give chance to the 'Arabs to say that we have yielded to you, but we 
will allow you next year."" So, the Prophet (ﷺ) got that written. 
Then Suhail said, ""We also stipulate that you should return to us whoever comes to you from us, even 
if he embraced your religion."" The Muslims said, ""Glorified be Allah! How will such a person be 
returned to the pagans after he has become a Muslim? While they were in this state Abu- Jandal bin 
Suhail bin `Amr came from the valley of Mecca staggering with his fetters and fell down amongst the 
Muslims. Suhail said, ""O Muhammad! This is the very first term with which we make peace with you, 
i.e. you shall return Abu Jandal to me."" The Prophet (ﷺ) said, ""The peace treaty has not been written yet."" 
Suhail said, ""I will never allow you to keep him."" The Prophet (ﷺ) said, ""Yes, do."" He said, ""I won't do.: 
Mikraz said, ""We allow you (to keep him)."" Abu Jandal said, ""O Muslims! Will I be returned to the 
pagans though I have come as a Muslim? Don't you see how much I have suffered?"" 
(continued...) 
(continuing... 1): -3.891:... ... 
Abu Jandal had been tortured severely for the Cause of Allah. `Umar bin Al-Khattab said, ""I went to 
the Prophet (ﷺ) and said, 'Aren't you truly the Messenger of Allah?' The Prophet (ﷺ) said, 'Yes, indeed.' I said, 
'Isn't our Cause just and the cause of the enemy unjust?' He said, 'Yes.' I said, 'Then why should we be 
humble in our religion?' He said, 'I am Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and I do not disobey Him, and He will make 
me victorious.' I said, 'Didn't you tell us that we would go to the Ka`ba and perform Tawaf around it?' 
He said, 'Yes, but did I tell you that we would visit the Ka`ba this year?' I said, 'No.' He said, 'So you 
will visit it and perform Tawaf around it?' "" `Umar further said, ""I went to Abu Bakr and said, 'O Abu 
Bakr! Isn't he truly Allah's Prophet?' He replied, 'Yes.' I said, 'Then why should we be humble in our 
religion?' He said, 'Indeed, he is Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and he does not disobey his Lord, and He will make 
him victorious. Adhere to him as, by Allah, he is on the right.' I said, 'Was he not telling us that we 
would go to the Ka`ba and perform Tawaf around it?' He said, 'Yes, but did he tell you that you would 
go to the Ka`ba this year?' I said, 'No.' He said, ""You will go to Ka`ba and perform Tawaf around it."" 
(Az-Zuhri said, "" `Umar said, 'I performed many good deeds as expiation for the improper questions I 
asked them.' "") 
When the writing of the peace treaty was concluded, Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said to his companions, ""Get up 
and' slaughter your sacrifices and get your head shaved."" By Allah none of them got up, and the 
Prophet repeated his order thrice. When none of them got up, he left them and went to Um Salama and 
told her of the people's attitudes towards him. Um Salama said, ""O the Prophet (ﷺ) of Allah! Do you want 
your order to be carried out? Go out and don't say a word to anybody till you have slaughtered your 
sacrifice and call your barber to shave your head."" So, the Prophet (ﷺ) went out and did not talk to anyone 
of them till he did that, i.e. slaughtered the sacrifice and called his barber who shaved his head. Seeing 
that, the companions of the Prophet (ﷺ) got up, slaughtered their sacrifices, and started shaving the heads 
of one another, and there was so much rush that there was a danger of killing each other. Then some 
believing women came (to the Prophet (ﷺ) ); and Allah revealed the following Divine Verses:-- 
""O you who believe, when the believing women come to you as emigrants examine them . . ."" (60.10) 
`Umar then divorced two wives of his who were infidels. Later on Muawiya bin Abu Sufyan married 
one of them, and Safwan bin Umaiya married the other. When the Prophet (ﷺ) returned to Medina, Abu 
Basir, a new Muslim convert from Quraish came to him. The Infidels sent in his pursuit two men who 
said (to the Prophet (ﷺ) ), ""Abide by the promise you gave us."" So, the Prophet (ﷺ) handed him over to them. 
They took him out (of the City) till they reached Dhul-Hulaifa where they dismounted to eat some 
dates they had with them. Abu Basir said to one of them, ""By Allah, O so-and-so, I see you have a 
fine sword."" The other drew it out (of the scabbard) and said, ""By Allah, it is very fine and I have tried 
it many times."" Abu Basir said, ""Let me have a look at it."" 
When the other gave it to him, he hit him with it till he died, and his companion ran away till he came 
to Medina and entered the Mosque running. When Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) saw him he said, ""This man 
appears to have been frightened."" When he reached the Prophet (ﷺ) he said, ""My companion has been 
murdered and I would have been murdered too."" Abu Basir came and said, ""O Allah's Messenger, by 
Allah, Allah has made you fulfill your obligations by your returning me to them (i.e. the Infidels), but 
Allah has saved me from them."" The Prophet (ﷺ) said, ""Woe to his mother! what excellent war kindler he 
would be, should he only have supporters."" When Abu Basir heard that he understood that the Prophet (ﷺ) 
would return him to them again, so he set off till he reached the seashore. Abu Jandal bin Suhail got 
himself released from them (i.e. infidels) and joined Abu Basir. So, whenever a man from Quraish 
embraced Islam he would follow Abu Basir till they formed a strong group. By Allah, whenever they 
heard about a caravan of Quraish heading towards Sham, they stopped it and attacked and killed them 
(i.e. infidels) and took their properties. The people of Quraish sent a message to the Prophet (ﷺ) 
requesting him for the Sake of Allah and Kith and kin to send for (i.e. Abu Basir and his companions) 
promising that whoever (amongst them) came to the Prophet (ﷺ) would be secure. So the Prophet (ﷺ) sent for 
them (i.e. Abu Basir's companions) and Allah I revealed the following Divine Verses: 
""And it is He Who Has withheld their hands from you and your hands From them in the midst of 
Mecca, After He made you the victorious over them. ... the unbelievers had pride and haughtiness, in 
their hearts ... the pride and haughtiness of the time of ignorance."" (48.24-26) And their pride and 
haughtiness was that they did not confess (write in the treaty) that he (i.e. Muhammad) was the 
Prophet of Allah and refused to write: ""In the Name of Allah, the most Beneficent, the Most 
Merciful,"" and they (the mushriks) prevented them (the Muslims) from visiting the House (the Ka`bah).",,Sahih
bukhari2733,bukhari,54,Bukhari,15,2733," Narrated Az-Zuhri: 
`Urwa said, ""Aisha told me that Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) used to examine the women 
emigrants. We have been told also that when Allah revealed the order that the Muslims should return 
to the pagans what they had spent on their wives who emigrated (after embracing Islam) and that the 
Muslims should not keep unbelieving women as their wives, `Umar divorced two of his wives, 
Qariba, the daughter of Abu Umayyah and the daughter of Jarwal Al-Khuza`i. Later on Mu`awiya 
married Qariba and Abu Jahm married the other."" 
When the pagans refused to pay what the Muslims had spent on their wives, Allah revealed: ""And if 
any of your wives have gone from you to the unbelievers and you have an accession (by the coming 
over of a woman from the other side) (then pay to those whose wives have gone) the equivalent of 
what they had spent (on their Mahr)."" (60.11) 
So, Allah ordered that the Muslim whose wife has gone, should be given, as a compensation of the 
Mahr he had given to his wife, from the Mahr of the wives of the pagans who had emigrated deserting 
their husbands. 
We do not know any of the women emigrants who deserted Islam after embracing it. We have also 
been told that Abu Basir bin Asid Ath-Thaqafi came to the Prophet (ﷺ) as a Muslim emigrant during the 
truce. Al-Akhnas bin Shariq wrote to the Prophet (ﷺ) requesting him to return Abu Basir.",,Sahih

Wala is for the one who manumits."" Then Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) ascended the pulpit and said, ""What about

towards her because of her beauty and wealth, and likes to marry her with a Mahr less than what is 
given to women of her standard. So they (i.e. guardians) were forbidden to marry the orphans unless 
they paid them a full appropriate Mahr (otherwise) they were ordered to marry other women instead of 
them. Later on the people asked Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) about it. So Allah revealed the following Verse:-- 
""They ask your instruction (O Muhammad!) regarding women. Say: Allah instructs you regarding 
them..."" (4.127)

have the desire to marry her without giving her an appropriate Mahr equal to what her peers could get, 
but if she was undesirable for lack of beauty or wealth, then he would not marry her, but seek to marry 
some other woman instead of her. So, since he did not marry her when he had no inclination towards

you think wealth is good?"" he repeated thrice, adding, ""No doubt, good produces nothing but good.

animals because of gluttony except the vegetation-eating animal which eats till both its flanks are full

This worldly property is sweet vegetation. How excellent the wealth of the Muslim is, if it is collected 
through legal means and is spent in Allah's Cause and on orphans, poor people and travelers. But he

it with a long tether on a meadow or in a garden with the result that whatever it eats from the area of 
the meadow or the garden where it is tied will be counted as good deeds for his benefit, and if it

no intention of watering it, even then he will get the reward for its drinking. As for the man for whom 
horses are a source of sins, he is the one who keeps a horse for the sake of pride and pretense and

asked about donkeys, he replied, ""Nothing has been revealed to me about them except this unique,
